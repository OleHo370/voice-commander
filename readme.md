# Lumen

Meet Lumen, an AI powered agent that can help those with less technical expertise navigate the web safely and quickly.

On top of being able to fully navigate using your voice (including scrolling, searching, clicking, zooming, and more), our AI agent can also help you navigate tricky pages by finding a button you're looking for or scanning the page to see if something exists. By drawing your attention to the relevant areas with a bright red circle, finding those tiny search bars or home buttons has never been so easy!
